Hello, I'm Anthony Le Gourriérec, a computer science engineer specializing in digital imaging, and a PhD student working on the *Perception and Representation of Urban Night Ambiances in Extended Reality (XR)* since June 2025.

This CIFRE-funded doctoral thesis is conducted in collaboration with:

- **L’Observatoire de la Nuit**, a consultancy specialized in night-time ambiances and light sobriety,
- **Centrale Nantes**, within the *Ambiances, Architectures, Urbanités (AAU)* research laboratory, as part of the *CRENAU* (Centre de Recherche Nantais Architectures Urbanités) team,
- and **IMT Atlantique**, within the *Lab-STICC* (Sciences et Techniques de l’Information, de la Communication et de la Connaissance), as part of the *INUIT* (Immersive Natural User Interaction) team.

My work focuses on developing immersive tools using augmented and virtual reality to simulate and evaluate urban lighting scenarios, with the goal of improving the perceptual understanding of night-time ambiances, supporting sustainable lighting strategies, and raising awareness about light pollution through interactive and site-specific visualizations.

My passion for digital imaging began over 15 years ago, sparked by watching YouTube tutorials and experimenting with 3D animation and photo montage on my family’s computer. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a deep interest in immersive technologies, computational imaging, and photography; blending technical precision with visual creativity.

This passion guided me through my engineering studies and early research projects, including internships where I developed XR prototypes and contributed to two patents on 3D scene adaptation. Today, it continues to drive my doctoral work on the perception of night-time urban lighting in XR, a subject where digital imaging becomes a tool not only for simulation, but also for cultural and environmental understanding.
