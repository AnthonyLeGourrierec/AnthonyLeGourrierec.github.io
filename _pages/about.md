Welcome to my professional website. I am Anthony Le Gourriérec, an aspiring digital imaging specialist. Currently, I am interning at Interdigital R&D France in Rennes, France, working in the XR over wireless team, where I conduct research on 3D scene elasticity.

As my internship comes to an end, along with my studies at ESIR (École Supérieure d’Ingénieur de Rennes), I am seeking new opportunities. I am looking for positions in XR, AI imaging, or more generally in digital imaging near Rennes, but I am also open to relocating across Europe or Canada for the right role.

On this website, you will find a wealth of information about me, providing insight into my professional and personal interests and capabilities. If you are interested in my profile, please do not hesitate to contact me on LinkedIn or by email. I will be more than happy to respond to your inquiries. Have a great read!
