Hello, I'm Anthony Le Gourriérec, a computer science engineer specializing in digital imaging. After completing my end-of-study internship at Interdigital R&D France in Rennes and graduating from ESIR (École Supérieure d’Ingénieur de Rennes), I'm eager to begin my professional career. I'm currently seeking opportunities in XR, AI imaging, or 3D and digital imaging, preferably near Rennes, but I'm also open to relocating for the right opportunity.

My passion for digital imaging began over 15 years ago, sparked by watching videos on YouTube. This curiosity led me to explore everything from 3D animation and photo montage on my family’s computer to, more recently, developing extended reality applications, AI-generated imagery, and photography. This passion guided me through my engineering studies and fueled my latest research internship, where I contributed to two patents on 3D scene adaptation—an achievement that reflects my dedication and commitment to the field.

If you’re intrigued by my profile, feel free to explore my [resume](/cv/) and [projects](/portfolio/). I'm always open to new opportunities and connections, so don't hesitate to reach out via the [contact page](/contact), via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonylegourrierec) or directly via [email](mailto:anthonylegourrierec@gmail.com). I look forward to hearing from you!
