## Overview

During my first and second year of engineering school, I took on the responsibility of organizing events as part of the student association. I leveraged these opportunities to create 3D renders and animations to enhance event promotions, trailers, and communications.

I produced four distinct 3D animations:
- **"ESIR à un incroyable talent"**: A talent show held every year.
- Two editions of **"Question pour un Esirien"**: A quiz-based event.
- **An animation for the campaign of a student list**, created prior to my position in the association.

All of these 3D animations were produced using **Blender**.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **3D Modeling & Animation**: Used Blender to create 3D animations for event promotions.
- **Event Communication**: Supported event marketing and engagement through visual storytelling and animated content.
- **Creativity Under Pressure**: Delivered 3D renders within tight deadlines leading up to each event.

**Technologies Used:** Blender, 3D Modeling, Animation

## Project Highlights

### Key Features

- **Event-Based 3D Animations**: Each animation was tailored to the event, from talent shows to quiz games and student association campaigns.
- **Multi-Edition Work**: Worked on two editions of "Question pour un Esirien," adapting the 3D renders to each edition.
- **Blender Mastery**: Developed models and animations entirely in Blender, showcasing a range of 3D modeling and animation techniques.

### Achievements

- **Event Enhancement**: The 3D animations were a hit among participants and boosted engagement for the events.
- **Valuable Contribution to Event Promotion**: Created 3D renders that were integral to the visual identity of the events, supporting the promotional efforts with engaging and memorable content.
- **Blender Expertise**: Refined Blender skills through repeated use for varied events, each with its own unique requirements.

### Results

The animations I produced for these events significantly contributed to their visibility and promotion. The attendees, as well as the organizers, appreciated the extra visual appeal brought by the 3D elements, which helped make the events more engaging and visually stimulating.

Here are the final 3D animations produced for the following events:
- **ESIR à un incroyable talent** (Talent Show)
- **Question pour un Esirien** (Quiz Event – Two Editions)
- **Student List Campaign Animation**

## Closing Thoughts

These 3D renders and animations played a role in elevating the student association events, providing engaging visual content that added depth and professionalism to the promotions. Through this project, I not only improved my skills in Blender but also learned how to use 3D animation as a tool for communication and engagement in a real-world context.
