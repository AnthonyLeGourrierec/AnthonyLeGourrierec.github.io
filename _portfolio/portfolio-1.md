## Project Overview

During engineering school, one of our English teachers encouraged us to engage in creative projects to enhance our portfolios. In response to this, my friend Marius and I decided to collaborate on a unique project where he could improve his web development skills while I focused on 3D product animation.

Together, we created a fictitious brand called "Margoulean" as part of a 10-hour English project. This playful endeavor allowed us to experiment with both web development and animation, resulting in a fully functional website and a series of animations.

Feel free to explore the project through the links below:

## Embracing Constraints and Overcoming Perfectionism

One of the most valuable lessons from this project was the importance of embracing constraints. As perfectionists, Marius and I often find it challenging to showcase our work, fearing it isn't polished enough. However, the freedom and the tight deadline of this project compelled us to move beyond our usual boundaries and deliver something tangible within the limited timeframe.

This constraint pushed us to prioritize creativity and functionality over endless tweaking. It was liberating to focus on producing a finished piece that could be shared and appreciated, rather than getting caught up in the quest for perfection.

## Experimentation and Innovation

Another highlight of this project was the opportunity to experiment with new techniques. For my part, I explored using **gobos** to create interesting shadow effects, adding depth and texture to the 3D renders. This experimentation was crucial in refining my skills in lighting and composition, providing a hands-on experience that was both challenging and rewarding.

## The Value of Collaboration

Working with a creative partner like Marius was a game-changer. It allowed us to provide immediate feedback to each other on various creative choices, such as modeling, lighting, and overall composition. This collaborative environment fostered a dynamic creative process, where ideas could be tested and refined in real-time, leading to a more cohesive and polished final product.
