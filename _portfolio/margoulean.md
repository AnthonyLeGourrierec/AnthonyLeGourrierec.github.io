## Overview

As part of an English class project during engineering school, a friend and I created "Margoulean," a fictional beverage brand. This collaborative effort allowed us to blend our skills—web development for my friend, Marius, and 3D product animation for myself—into a cohesive project. Over a span of 10 hours, we developed a website and a series of 3D animations showcasing the brand.
